# FIFA-Player-Rating-Predictor
This project predicts the overall rating of a Player in FIFA 20. 
# Understanding of the model
My model analyzes different attributes of player inorder to predict the overall rating of a player. This would be beneficial if this model is implemented in any new soccer game. 
The dataset of Fifa 20, ie, "Players_20.csv" was taken from Kaggle. 
Implemented Various Regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGboost Regression to check which model is the most accurate for predictions. 
Used various performance measures like High R2_score, Low RMSE which gives a brief idea of the error margin. 
Fine-tuned the model with hyper-parameters manually for better results.
